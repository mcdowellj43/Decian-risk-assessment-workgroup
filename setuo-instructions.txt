1. Open PowerShell

Press Start

Type PowerShell

Right-click and choose Run as Administrator

(If testing under a standard user, run normally — but some checks may require elevation.)

2. Download the Script

Windows 10 and 11 come with curl and PowerShell’s Invoke-WebRequest, so you may use either method.

Option A — Download with PowerShell (recommended)

Run this command:

iwr -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcdowellj43/Decian-risk-assessment-workgroup/main/scripts/windows-noadminpriv.ps1" -OutFile "windows-noadminpriv.ps1"

Option B — Download with curl (also built-in)

Run this command:

curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcdowellj43/Decian-risk-assessment-workgroup/main/scripts/windows-noadminpriv.ps1" -o windows-noadminpriv.ps1


This will save the script into the current folder as windows-noadminpriv.ps1.

3. Allow PowerShell to Run Scripts (if required)

Some systems block unsigned scripts.
If PowerShell shows an execution policy error, run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass


(This only affects the current PowerShell window.)

4. Run the Script

Now execute:

.\windows-noadminpriv.ps1


The script will run checks and show PASS/FAIL items directly in the console.
